# Mortage Document Analysis Using RAG

📄 Mortgage Document Analysis Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Overview

Mortgage documents are lengthy, complex, and time-consuming to process manually. Human review is not only slow, but also prone to inconsistencies and errors—especially when extracting key information across large volumes of documents.

This project addresses that problem by building an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that enables fast, accurate, and context-aware information retrieval from mortgage documents using modern LLM tooling.

The system allows users to query mortgage documents and retrieve the most relevant sections, augmented with large language model reasoning for clearer, more reliable answers.

Problem Statement:

Mortgage documents often exceed hundreds of pages

Manual review is:

- Time-intensive
- Error-prone
- Difficult to scale
- Critical information (rates, clauses, borrower obligations) can be missed or misinterpreted

Goal:
Reduce processing time and improve accuracy by enabling intelligent document querying through a RAG-based system.
